# PyGame-Projects
These are some games I have made using the pygame library (but not limited to) just as a hobby. At some point I want to make a big game project for a thought I have that may or may not use pygame, but we will see! Also if my grammar is off, well I am here for the business of CS not English Literature :)

## Ok some requirements for these projects:

-Pygame library

haha, yeah thats all, just one requirment, might need to load up a virtual envioment to run these files unless you already have pygame installed globally or something. However, in future projects might also look into Pymunk  and other libraries so keep an eye out for that as well!

Ok. Now about the projects themselves:

## FirstPyGame:
We all start somewhere, and the first time ever I started pygame I learnt it from youtube videos, mainly from a youtuber: Tech with Tim and a tutorial he did with Pygame, but I also followed a tutorial initally by Coding with Russ as well! I thought to include this project just to show where I started from.

## Bouncing Ball:
After completing my first project, I really wanted to try to independently make my own ball physics game, of well just a bouncing ball. It took a while and I did take a small break to work on my dissertation. But I got there in the end :) Quite proud I was able to do it even though the project itself isn't anything to write home about. This project would become the pre-requiste for my Pong game.

## Pong Game:
The pre-requiste of Bouncing ball, after I completed that project, I immedieatly moved to try and do this project. I managed to do this in one day but I did use my code from the previous project to speed up the setting up the ball mechanics but there are some notable changes made to said ball.

## OOP Platfomer
Refreshed myself with OOP with this platformer game which I got a lot of help from the tutorial by Coding with Russ. I plan on making a bigger and more comprehensive platformer now.
